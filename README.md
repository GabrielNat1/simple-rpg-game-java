# Mini RPG - Java Study Project

This is a mini RPG project made in Java, created to learn basic programming concepts like classes, methods, packages, and simple console interaction.

---

## 🚀 How it works

The project is divided into packages to organize the classes:

- `com.myrpg` — contains the main class (`Main`) that starts the game.  
- `com.myrpg.character` — contains the `Hero` class, representing the main character.  
- `com.myrpg.battle` — contains the `CombatManager` class, which handles battles.

---

## 📋 Features

- Create a hero with a name and health points (HP).  
- Simple combat where the hero attacks and takes damage.  
- Display messages on the console for basic interaction.

## 🛠️ How to run

1. Clone or download the project.  
2. Compile the `.java` files inside their folders.  
3. Run the `Main` class to start the game.

Example using terminal:

```bash
javac com/myrpg/Main.java com/myrpg/character/Hero.java com/myrpg/battle/CombatManager.java
java com.myrpg.Main
```

## 📚 Concepts learned

- Java package structure.  
- Classes, attributes, and methods.  
- Access modifiers (`public` and `private`).  
- Using `this` to refer to the current object.  
- The `main` method as the entry point.  
- `void` modifier and methods returning values.  
- Simple console output handling.

## 🤝 Next steps

- Add user interaction using `Scanner`.  
- Implement multiple enemies.  
- Create an inventory and item system.  
- Improve combat system with turns and varied attacks.
